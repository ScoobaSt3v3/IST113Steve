  <h1>Steve's Bio</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Steve.  I am married with two sons.  My wife and I have been together since highschool, some 22 years ago.  Aydin, my oldest son, is 14 and his youger brother, Caeleb, is 10.  Being in school my hobbies have taken the back burner a bit, and I can't wait to get back to them in full force.  We also have a Boston Terrier named Summit.
